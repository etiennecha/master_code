## My econ research repository

This repository contains the code of virtually all the economic research projects I have been or am currently working on. Some of them are not really meant to be public (tests, drafts etc) and are thus not listed or adequately described in the overview provided below.

----------

### code_gasoline_france

In 2007, a governmental website was launched in France to increase transparency in the retail gasoline market. Data obtained from this website and various other sources are used in two research projects. The first focuses on consumer information and price dispersion. The second studies the launch of the low cost chain "Total Access" by "Total" (a large oil company and historical gas station operator in France) and its impact on competition.

### code_supermarkets_france

In 2006, the French supermarket chain Leclerc launched a website with a view to demonstrate the competitiveness of its prices vs. other retail chains operating in France. Data obtained from the website, combined with data collected online from "drive" stores are used to study price strategies and competition in the French supermarket industry. Though data about store locations and characteristics have been collected online, I generally use data purchased from LSA (which I thus unfortunately cannot share) when it comes to store locations and characteristics.

### code_physicians_france

The French national health insurance agency operates a website which lists physicians and prices. Data collected from the website are used to study physician locations and price levels (in the case of physicians with unregulated fees) compared to health demand approximated by population characteristics.

### code_insee

INSEE is the French national institute of statistics. It offers a lot of data at the municipality level with municipalities being identified by a unique code. The folder contains a module which allows to obtain this code from other information more commonly found such as city name, department, zip code etc. as well as various data extraction and processing scripts.

### code_maps

Small use cases of geographic data processing, and/or analysis (OSM data extraction, routing, display of Velib' bike availability etc.)

### code_test

Small tests of data display with Google Fusion Tables and Leaflet as well as wine price data scraping from large supermarket chains in France.
