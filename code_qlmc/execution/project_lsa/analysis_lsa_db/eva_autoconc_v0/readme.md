First version of a project aimed at discussing techniques used by the French competition authority to assess competition:

- ta_autconc_H.py : assess competition between hypermarkets based on radius of 25 km (competition authority)

- ta_continuous_H.py : assess competition between hypermarkets with weighting by distance (alternative method proposed)

- ta_autconc_and_continuous_H.py : assess competition between hypermarkets with both methods

- ta_autconc_and_continuous_H_and_S.py : assess competition between hypermarkets with both methods, then between supermarkets (hypermarkets and discounters also taken into account)
