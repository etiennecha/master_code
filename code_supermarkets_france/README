TODO:

Crucial:
- Matching Monoprix vs. kml
- Matching of supermarket location data vs. INSEE data (either gps or zip/city)
- Matching of supermarket location data vs. qlmc supermarkets

Less urgent:
- Franprix: visit small links to get zip code
- create folder for standardization of scraped info (incl. kml and matching intermarche etc)
- check info on hours: drop or add for all stores (except at least aldi... or specific scraping)
- Netto: geocoding? google text search if not too many?
- Norma: 72 stores (quite a few sold recently): check with google text search (e.g. Paris/Lyon)
- Geant: 3 HD stores (Geant Discount) 2005-2011: Boissy St Leger, Marmande, Toulouse Basso Cambo...

REMARKS:
- Google text search can be used a posteriori to check coverage of competition
- OSM: both a priori (todo) and a posteriori to check coverage of competition
